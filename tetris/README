Overview: This project creates a game of Tetris that the user can play. The project consists of an
App class, which is the highest level class which creates the Scene and Stage that allows the App
to be displayed. The App class instantiates PaneOrganizer, which creates the root node, and sets up all
the necessary panes. PaneOrganizer also instantiates the Game class, which is the highest level logic
class which populates all of the panes and runs the game. The Game class creates instances of the
Board and TetrisPiece class. These two classes are responsible for wrapping a 2d array of TetrisSquares
simulating the board, and a 1d array of TetrisSquares which represent a given tetris piece respectively.
The TetrisSquare class is a wrapper class for Javafx Rectangle, and are the graphical building blocks of
the app. The Game class calls methods in both the TetrisPiece and the Board class to determine
information about the state of the Board and location of the current TetrisPiece. The game
then combines this information with user input to dictate how the game should function.

Design Choices: A 2D array of TetrisSquares was chosen to represent the board in Tetris because the
board is composed of rows and columns, and 2D arrays are naturally good at storing information
in this form. On the other hand, each individual TetrisPiece was stored as an array of four
TetrisSquares, with an accompanying 2d array of integers which described the position of the
piece on the board. This design choice allowed for the program to easily distinguish between
graphical and logical components, as the array of TetrisSquare represent the graphical component
and the array of coordinates represent their logical position in the board. All of the elements
stored in arrays were access using for loops, which allowed for much greater control over which
parts of the array were accessed to implement methods such as line clearing.
